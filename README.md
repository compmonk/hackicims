# hackicims
This is the project for HackRU Spring 2019 with the use of hackicims.com API. I have done an EDA of the jobs, people and applications data we got from the API finding out some key points like which city provides with the most number of applications for a particular job title, which city gives the maximum number of people where people get accepted or rejected, etc.
